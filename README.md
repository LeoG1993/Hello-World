# Hello-World
//First repo just 2 see what's up
=================================
Leo is here, getting back to computering world first since I was a teenager, around '08-'09.
Currently, I'm a 2nd year student for LL.B and BA in Economics, at The College of Management.
Altough the worlds of Law and Economics are quite interesting, I had the urge to check if computering is still doable for me. So here I am, signed to github with that intention.
Will it work out? We'll see.
